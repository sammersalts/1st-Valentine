            I didn’t stumble into you. It wasn’t love at first sight, no grand epiphany, no world-tilting moment. It wasn’t sudden, wasn’t overwhelming. It was quieter than that. Softer. Like recognition.<br><br>
            Like oh. It’s you. Of course, it’s you. I don’t know how I knew—only that I did. That from the moment we spoke, there was no awkwardness, no hesitation, just the easy kind of knowing. Like flipping to the right page without meaning to. Like hearing a song for the first time and already knowing the melody.<br><br>
            I wasn’t looking, wasn’t waiting, wasn’t hoping. But then you arrived. Slowly, then all at once. And now, the world feels different. Brighter. Less predictable, less empty.<br><br>
            I chose this. I chose you. The late-night conversations, the teasing, the silences that somehow feel louder than words. I chose the way your energy shifts when you think I’m losing interest, the way your voice softens when you’re trying not to show you care too much. I chose the laughter, the stubbornness, the way you frustrate me. Still, I chose to stay, even when you made things difficult with your spoiled, cynical attempts to shut me out.<br><br>
            And I don’t know what kind of magic this is, how a voice from a screen, a name on my phone, could feel like something real—something that lingers, something I catch myself holding onto when I should be sleeping. You talk, and I listen, bewitched, bothered, bewildered, but always willingly. Happily.<br><br>
            I used to think love had to be loud, had to be certain, had to be a grand, sweeping thing. But then you. And now I know better.<br><br>
            So today, when the world dresses itself in pinks and reds, when love is measured in roses and candlelit dinners, I find myself wanting none of it. Just you and the way you make my world feel less lonely, the way your words fill the spaces I didn’t even know were empty.<br><br>
            And if this is love, this quiet, yet somehow chaotic kind that doesn’t need grand declarations to mean something, then I want it. I want you. Not just today, not just when love feels easy, but always.<br><br>
            I don’t know if I believe in fate. Maybe the universe had a hand in this, maybe it didn’t. But if I were given a hundred lifetimes, a hundred chances to do this over, I’d still find you. I’d still choose you. In every version of my life, in every world where we exist—always, always you.
